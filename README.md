# Adaptive Ratchets and the Evolution of Moluecular Complexity

This repository contains the supplementary information the paper: []().

This repo contains a Mathematica notebook `adaptive ratchets.nb`, which reproduces Figures 1-4, as well as all supplementary figures. Curation to axis labels and fonts were done in Adobe Illustrator, using the output of the Mathematica notebook. The Python script `immune_dynamics.py` contains simulations which produce a text file as basis for Figure 5B, which is plotted in the Mathematica notebook `fig5b.nb`. Adjust the file paths in this notebook appropriately.
